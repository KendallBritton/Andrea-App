            I love this day! I love this day simply based on how happy and infatuated you were, everything additional was just icing on the cake.
            I hope you felt that this day was perfect for you, and that Andy the Art Queen herself, was delivered a canvas that she'll remember
            till the end of time. I love you so much, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. <br><br>
            Let's relive this day together, and remember the love we have for each other.

            Your day started by what I assume was a normal day at the apartment. (Maybe not because you knew your schedule changed at Giddy). You were surprised by your cousin Kelsey with a bouquet
            of flowers and a note from me to start you on your day. First stop, nails done!

        <div class="section-text">
            After your nails freshly polished, it was time for a little snack and relaxtion to process the morning so far. Heading back to the apartment, you were met with a second note, and a new piece of
            wardrobe to get you through the rest of the day. This jawdropping dress that I knew would be perfect for you and your upcoming dinner reservation!

            At Mama Ricotta's, I hope you felt a sense of ease as there was one part of the day where you knew what to expect for a brief moment. I wanted to make sure that you a little time and space to breathe
            with everything that was happening. As you sat down for dinner, another familiar face and close friend, Ms. Devon Werner, joined you for your special moment. Meanwhile, you were also presented with 
            the third and final not of the day, which indicated where you were headed next. Hopefully the drive wasn't too bad!
